            <p>In 2019, I vividly recall making vlogs with my friends and editing videos for them just for fun. At the time, I wasn't even aware of software like Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and After Effects; I was using Kinemaster, a basic editing software compared to the more advanced ones. YouTube served as my film school. I didn't follow the library method to learn, but rather the workshop method. If I didn't know something, I would simply look it up on YouTube and follow tutorials. But why i'm i saying all of this ? Believe me these are important to connect the dots at the end
            </p>
             <br><p>Let's return to the story I was sharing. In 2021, I had the opportunity to join the club member at my Pre university college for Commerce for action club . My primary objective in joining the club was to showcase my skills, with no expectations of receiving anything in return. However, a senior member of the club, who happened to be quite cool, reached out to me. They asked, "Would you be interested in working as a video editing intern for Munity International?" They mentioned that the position was unpaid, which might make you wonder, "Unpaid? Who would work for free?"Yes, I have the same mindset for now . But I was just in 11th grade, I was a jobless fella and I was so much excited after just hearing the word “Internship”. Interestingly, in the end, they decided to pay me for my work because they were impressed with it. This was a pivotal moment for me, and I questioned, "Do they genuinely value my time and skills?" I had managed to monetize my skills out of nothing ,without any formal paid courses; my only investment was my time. Following that experience, I continued working for their sister organization, "We Mun," and eventually transitioned from being an intern to calling myself a Creative Director. While my role there was limited due to our operations being focused on Model United Nations (MUN) seasons, the learning curve in terms of networking and team management was steep.
            
            Now, you might be wondering how I landed an internship at Unacademy. Let's get to that part shortly.In 2023 I was in 12th grade , I had the opportunity to represent the Media Club at my Pre-University Claret and met a remarkable mentor. This led to an unpaid internship at I.I.M.U.N as a social media intern.The pre university life was over . During this time, I had completed my board exams and had 3 months before college was set to start. I spent this time applying for various internship opportunities listed on Internshala. I understood that it was a game of probabilities, but I soon realized I was mistaken. I remember facing rejections and non-responses from recruiters. Some offered interview opportunities, but I wasn't successful in those. Does this sound too generic? Unfortunately, this was my reality.
            
            Then came an email from Internshala with the subject line "1 new message from Unacademy." The excitement was like Chandrayaan 3 landing on the moon . I was fortunate that the interview was relatively straightforward and heavily based on my previous work (portfolio). After navigating the process of document submission and HR verification, I received an email that read:</p>
             <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> “Welcome to Unacademy, Rakshit Kumar! #LetsCrackIt! Congratulations on becoming a part of the Unacademy Family.
            
            We are excited to have you onboard and are truly delighted to empower you to crack your career goals as you contribute to our mission of democratising knowledge across India. “</p></blockquote>
            
            
                        <p>Man that mail made may month not day . But I had a question “did they choose the right person mistakenly?” I was too lucky ?
            
            
             I asked my manager why he chose me out of so many applicants out there. He told me that “You're here just because of our portfolio website” and I asked another question again. Other people also submitted the portfolio, right ? . He replied “Yours is creative “. I learned a lesson with those two lines from my manager. He might have found equally good or better editors than me but You must stand out of the crowd saying I'm different and unique and creativity is an ultimate tool for this .No AI can Replace you When you are Creative in your own way.It can only help to work more efficiently.Portfolio website >CV.
            </p>
             <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> “Oh, I almost forgot to connect the dots. Reflecting on those unpaid and partially paid internships and clubs, I consider them essential tools for learning and advancing in terms of creativity. I still uphold the belief of "trusting the process." Rejections might come your way, but if you trust the process and infuse your creativity, you'll eventually find yourself in a better place, perhaps with a touch of luck.
             “</p></blockquote>
